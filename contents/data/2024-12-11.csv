  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]",Title:Random regular graph states are complex at almost any depth,"Authors:Soumik Ghosh, Dominik Hangleiter, Jonas Helsen","Abstract:Graph states are fundamental objects in the theory of quantum information due to their simple classical description and rich entanglement structure. They are also intimately related to IQP circuits, which have applications in quantum pseudorandomness and quantum advantage. For us, they are a toy model to understand the relation between circuit connectivity, entanglement structure and computational complexity. In the worst case, a strict dichotomy in the computational universality of such graph states appears as a function of the degree $d$ of a regular graph state [GDH+23]. In this paper, we initiate the study of the average-case complexity of simulating random graph states of varying degree when measured in random product bases and give distinct evidence that a similar complexity-theoretic dichotomy exists in the average case. Specifically, we consider random $d$-regular graph states and prove three distinct results: First, we exhibit two families of IQP circuits of depth $d$ and show that they anticoncentrate for any $2 < d = o(n)$ when measured in a random $X$-$Y$-plane product basis. This implies anticoncentration for random constant-regular graph states. Second, in the regime $d = \Theta(n^c)$ with $c \in (0,1)$, we prove that random $d$-regular graph states contain polynomially large grid graphs as induced subgraphs with high probability. This implies that they are universal resource states for measurement-based computation. Third, in the regime of high degree ($d\sim n/2$), we show that random graph states are not sufficiently entangled to be trivially classically simulable, unlike Haar random states. Proving the three results requires different techniques--the analysis of a classical statistical-mechanics model using Krawtchouck polynomials, graph theoretic analysis using the switching method, and analysis of the ranks of submatrices of random adjacency matrices, respectively.

  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]",Title:Exploiting SU(N ) dynamical symmetry for rovibronic stabilization of a weakly bound diatomic molecule,"Authors:Diego F. Uribe, Mateo Londoño, Julio C. Arce","Abstract:We propose a multilevel scheme to coherently transfer the population of a diatomic molecule from a rovibrational level to a target rovibrational level of the same electronic state or another. It involves a linear chain of N rovibrational levels alternating between the initial electronic state and a second electronic state, conveniently selected according to the dipole couplings between consecutive levels. A set of N - 1 simultaneous weak laser $\pi$ pulses, with simple analytical shapes, each in resonance between two neighbors of the chain, transfers the population from the initial rovibronic state gradually and consecutively through the chain, until at the end of the process it resides in the target rovibronic state, as in a kind of ping-pong game between the two electronic states. Using the partial-wave expansion of the molecular wave function, vibrational bases within the J manifolds of each electronic state, and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we map the radial Hamiltonian to the one of a spin s = (N - 1)/2 under a static magnetic field, providing an analytical formula for the populations of the linked states. As an illustration, we apply the scheme to the stabilization into the absolute ground state of a KRb molecule initially in the high-lying $\upsilon$ = 75, J = 6 level of the ground electronic state $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}$. With a chain of seven rovibronic states, three of them belonging to the excited $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic state, and pulses of 0.4 ns of duration, the population is fully transferred into the target state in about 1 ns.

We introduce the notion of \enquote{Volume of Assistance} (VoA), which computes the geometric mean of entanglement of assistance across all potential parties. We demonstrate the feasibility of VoA for three-qubit pure states and certain classes of pure tripartite qudit states. We have extended this measure to four-qubit states and general multipartite scenarios. We have done a comparative analysis to illustrate VoA's distinctiveness from established entanglement measures, notably showing it serves as an upper bound for the much celebrated generalized geometric measure (GGM). Remarkably, VoA excels in distinguishing a broad class of states that elude differentiation by the recently proposed Minimum Pairwise Concurrence (MPC) measure. Finally, VoA is applied to quantify genuine entanglement in the ground states of a three-qubit Heisenberg XY model, which highlights its practical utility in quantum information processing tasks.

It is a negative contribution to the pressure and energy of the gas, that at high densities will overwhelm the ideal gas contributions and make the gas implode into a black hole. Nature obviously constrains this term, avoiding this fate, but how?

However, OPA waveguide designs have not yet achieved the phase-matching conditions for type-0 operation in a single spectro-temporal mode, limiting their use. We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator. These results demonstrate a promising direction for integrated OPAs in a wide range of ultrafast quantum nanophotonics applications.

  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]",Title:Searching for the classical analogue of Hawking radiation and screening of Coulomb field by the horizon,"Authors:S.A. Paston, D.S. Shatkov","Abstract:We investigate the possibility of the existence of a classical analogue of Hawking radiation -- solutions to classical field equations that consist solely of outgoing waves, in the spacetime of a collapsing black hole. The non-static nature of the corresponding metric results in the absence of energy conservation for matter, which could otherwise a priori prohibit such solutions. A specific and simple scenario is considered: a black hole formation as a result of the collapse of a thin shell, which is not necessarily dust-like. In the corresponding spacetime, we study solutions of the equations for a real massless scalar field that take the form of purely outgoing waves. In addition to the homogeneous equation, we also examine the case of a constant point source of the field located at the symmetry center. The general solution outside the shell is expressed in terms of the confluent Heun function, while the equations inside the shell and the matching conditions at its surface are formulated as an integral equation. The analysis of various solution asymptotics enables the reduction of the integral equation to a matrix equation, which is subsequently solved numerically.

  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]",Title:Scalar-tensor Baryogenesis,Authors:David S. Pereira,"Abstract:We propose a baryogenesis mechanism termed scalar-tensor baryogenesis, analogous to gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis, driven by scalar fields arising from the scalar-tensor representation of modified gravity theories. This mechanism reproduces the original interaction term of gravitational baryogenesis and those commonly introduced in modified gravity contexts. We demonstrate the mechanism within $f(R,T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity frameworks, focusing on $f(R)$. We explore a quintessence potential given by $V(\phi) = \alpha \frac{\phi^{m+1}}{m+1}$ and a potential given $V(\phi) = \beta^{-\frac{1}{n-1}}(n-1)\left(\frac{\phi - 1}{n}\right)^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$ that corresponds in the geometric representation to models of the form $R + \beta R^n$. The model with $n=2$ presented the best behavior in generating an acceptable asymmetry during the radiation-dominated epoch. Inspired by this result, employing Planck data, we explored the Starobinsky inflation model obtaining successful baryogenesis during the inflationary epoch for both gravitational and scalar-tensor baryogenesis.

Present implementations on actual quantum devices face decoherence issues, which compromise the quality of long strings computation. In this work, we focus on the Measure Once 1-way Quantum Finite Automata (MO1QFA) model for addressing the MOD^p problem, investigating how quantum errors may affect the quality of the computation in this model when implemented in IBM-Q superconducting environment. To improve the performance of the implementation, we use pulse-level programming for calibrating a fast single-qubit gate designed specifically for the automaton implementation. The demonstrations conducted on the Jakarta quantum computer show that using custom pulses significantly reduces errors during extended word computations. While realizing improvements in error variations and predictability -- with a fourfold reduction in circuit latency -- the proposed solution demonstrates a substantial increase in the supported computation length of the automaton. When considering thresholds of 10% and 20% in absolute errors of acceptance probabilities, the solution has the potential to increase the maximum word length by 12 and 7+ times, respectively, compared to the default Qiskit gate.

  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]",Title:Do we owe our existence to a Gravitational Anomaly?,Authors:Nick E. Mavromatos,"Abstract:I review a mechanism for a potential explanation of the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe (``our existence''), based on a (3+1)-dimensional string-inspired cosmological model, characterised by (uncancelled) gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalies in the premordial epochs. The model is consistent with general covariance but entails spontaneous Lorentz (LV) and CPT Violation (CPTV), due to appropriate backgrounds of axion fields, which couple to the anomaly terms. Upon condensation of the gCS terms, due to primordial gravitational waves, these axions acquire a linear potential, which drives inflation of a Running-Vacuum-Model (RVM) type, while the effective action is also characterised by imaginary parts as well, which imply metastability of this RVM inflation. The axion backgrounds remain undiluted until the exit from inflation, and are responsible for yielding unconventional LV and CPTV Leptogenesis, which is then communicated to the baryon sector (Baryogenesis) via sphaleron processes. The model provides a phenomenologically consistent cosmological evolution from inflation till the modern era.    ",タイトル：私たちは自分の存在を重力の異常に借りていますか？,著者：ニックE.マブロマトス

They allow for dense coverage of the parameter space of binary black hole (BBH) mergers for purposes of parameter inference, or, more generally, match filtering tasks, while avoiding the computationally expensive full evolution of numerical relativity simulations. However, this comes at a slight cost in terms of accuracy when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, depending on the approach. One way to minimize this is by constructing so-called~\textit{surrogate models} which, instead of using approximate physics or phenomenological formulae, rather interpolate within the space of numerical relativity waveforms. In this work, we introduce~\texttt{NRSurNN3dq4}, a surrogate model for non-precessing BBH merger waveforms powered by neural networks. By relying on the power of deep learning, this approximant is remarkably fast and competitively accurate, as it can generate millions of waveforms in a tenth of a second, while mismatches with numerical relativity waveforms are restrained below $10^{-3}$. We implement this approximant within the~\textsc{bilby} framework for gravitational-wave parameter inference, and show that it it is suitable for parameter estimation tasks.

The nearest-future type of quantum repeater requires two operations: entanglement generation across neighbouring repeaters and entanglement swapping to promote short-range entanglement to long-range. For many hardware setups, these actions are probabilistic, leading to longer distribution times and incurred errors. Significant efforts have been vested in finding the optimal entanglement-distribution policy, i.e. the protocol specifying when a network node needs to generate or swap entanglement, such that the expected time to distribute long-distance entanglement is minimal. This problem is even more intricate in more realistic scenarios, especially when classical communication delays are taken into account. In this work, we formulate our problem as a Markov decision problem and use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimise over centralised strategies, where one designated node instructs other nodes which actions to perform. Contrary to most RL models, ours can be readily interpreted. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a fixed local policy, the `predictive swap-asap' policy, where nodes only coordinate with nearest neighbours. Compared to the straightforward generalization of the common swap-asap policy to the scenario with classical communication effects, the `wait-for-broadcast swap-asap' policy, both of the aforementioned entanglement-delivery policies are faster at high success probabilities. Our work showcases the merit of considering policies acting with incomplete information in the realistic case when classical communication effects are significant.

The core elements are Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebras and factorization algebras, following a program by Costello and Gwilliam. The BV algebras are the spaces of quantum observables ${\rm Obs}^q(I)$ given by the symmetric algebra of polynomials in compactly supported functions on some interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$, which can be viewed as functionals on the dynamical variables. Generalizing associative algebras, factorization algebras include in their data a topological space, which here is $\mathbb{R}$, and an assignment of a vector space to each open set, which here is the assignment of ${\rm Obs}^q(I)$ to each open interval $I$. The central structure maps are bilinear ${\rm Obs}^q(I_1)\otimes {\rm Obs}^q(I_2)\rightarrow {\rm Obs}^q(J)$ for disjoint intervals $I_1$ and $I_2$ contained in an interval $J$, which here is the wedge product of the symmetric algebra. We prove, as the central result of this paper, that this factorization algebra is quasi-isomorphic to the factorization algebra of `on-shell' quantum mechanics. In this we extend previous work by including half-open and closed intervals, and by generalizing to the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system.    ",タイトル：間隔での因数分解代数としてのオフシェル量子力学,著者：クリストフ・チアフリーノ、ノア・ハッサン、オラフ・ホーム

Vu","Abstract:We present successful evolutions of binary black hole mergers using a novel numerical-relativity technique known as Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM). This approach eliminates systematic errors associated with boundary conditions, effectively extending the computational domain to infinity. As an important application, we use CCM to resolve a late-time power-law tail in the gravitational wave from a head-on collision, and show that the tail is highly suppressed in a quasi-circular binary. Our results for the two extreme cases (orbital eccentricity $=0,1$) support the fact that tails increase with orbital eccentricity. Therefore, CCM paves the way for a detailed understanding of tails in eccentric systems. For the head-on case, we find that the tail behavior is consistent with predictions in the intermediate regime from black hole linear perturbation theory. However, we also raise the possibility that the power-law tail could be generated nonlinearly by quasinormal modes. The nonlinear contribution is expected to decay slower than predicted by Price's law, potentially dominating the signal at late times. If confirmed as nonlinear, this would be an example where nonlinearity prevails over linearity in the late-time regime of black hole dynamics.

Roque, Olivier Sarbach","Abstract:In this paper we follow an effective theory approach to study the nonrelativistic limit of a selfgravitating and selfinteracting massive vector field. Our effective theory is characterized by three parameters: the field's mass $m_0$ and the selfinteraction constants $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda_s$. For definiteness, we focus on a systematic study of the equilibrium configurations, commonly referred to as Proca stars when they have finite energy. We identify two different types of Proca stars, depending on the specific sector of the effective theory that we are exploring. In the generic sector, defined by $\lambda_s\neq 0$, all equilibrium configurations are stationary states described by wave functions that evolve harmonically in time. However, in the symmetry-enhanced sector, for which $\lambda_s=0$, there exist multi-frequency states whose wave functions oscillate with two or three distinct frequencies in addition to the stationary states. We determine the conditions under which a ground state configuration with fixed particle number exists. When these conditions are met, we prove that the lowest energy is reached by a stationary spherically symmetric configuration of constant polarization that is linear or circular depending on the sign of $\lambda_s$. We numerically construct some illustrative examples of spherical stationary and multi-frequency solutions, analyze their properties, and compare them with our analytical predictions. Unlike stationary states and other soliton configurations, which form a discrete set in the solution space associated with fixed particle number, the symmetry-enhanced sector exhibits a continuum of solutions with multi-frequency states connecting stationary states of constant polarization.

Most studies to date have focused on fine-tuned catalytic processes that are highly sensitive to error: if the initial state of the system deviates even slightly from that for which the catalyst was designed, the catalyst would be irreparably degraded. To address this challenge, we introduce and study robust catalytic transformations and explore the extent of their capabilities. It turns out that robust catalysis is subtly related to the property of resource broadcasting. In particular, we show that the possibility of robust catalysis is equivalent to that of resource broadcasting in completely resource non-generating theories. This allows us to characterize a general class of resource theories that allow neither robust catalysis nor resource broadcasting, and another class where instead resource broadcasting and robust catalysis are possible and provide maximal advantage.

  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]",Title:Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation,"Authors:David Jonas Moser, Lukas Janssen","Abstract:A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$.

We show that they span a Hilbert space with a dimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate black hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium setting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the entropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and atypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time state becomes fully known to an external observer.

  [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]","Title:Reciprocal lumped-element superconducting circuits: quantization, decomposition, and model extraction","Authors:Basil M. Smitham, Andrew A. Houck","Abstract:In this work, we introduce new methods for the quantization, decomposition, and extraction (from electromagnetic simulations) of lumped-element circuit models for superconducting quantum devices. Our flux-charge symmetric procedures center on the network matrix, which encodes the connectivity of a circuit's inductive loops and capacitive nodes. First, we use the network matrix to demonstrate a simple algorithm for circuit quantization, giving novel predictions for the Hamiltonians of circuits with both Josephson junctions and quantum phase slip wires. We then show that by performing pivoting operations on the network matrix, we can decompose a superconducting circuit model into its simplest equivalent ""fundamental"" form, in which the harmonic degrees of freedom are separated out from the Josephson junctions and phase slip wires. Finally, we illustrate how to extract an exact, transformerless circuit model from electromagnetic simulations of a device's hybrid admittance/impedance response matrix, by matching the lumped circuit's network matrix to the network topology of the physical layout. Overall, we provide a toolkit of intuitive methods that can be used to construct, analyze, and manipulate superconducting circuit models.
